# dismathportfolio-rossillaga

#Week 1
  - Discrete Mathematics(DISMATH) was introduced to us.
  - We learned about proof, proposition, logical deduction, and axiom
  - We were also taught the logical connectives like negation, conjunctions, disjunctions, conditionals and biconditionals.
  - The topics were pretty hard to understand, but eventually, I understood most of it

#Week 2
  - We discussed predicate logic, quantifiers, and rules of inference.
  - Arguments are series of statements leading to a conclusion.
  - We found out that Tautology are statements that are always true.
  - We learned all about Logical Equivalence which is similar to algebra.

#Week 3
  - We were asked to do an assigment to prove that Superman doesn't exist.
  - Our professor showed us how to solve other problems similar to our homework.
  - We were taught about Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hyphothetical Syllogism, Disjunctive syllogism, Addition, Simplification,          Conjunction, and Resolution.

#Week 4
  - We learned different kinds of proof.
  - Direct Proof: 1st step: Assume p is true. 2nd step: Show that q is also true by step 1
  - Contraposition: 1st step: Assume that "not q" is true 2nd step: Show that "not p" is also true by step 1
  - Vacuous Proof: 1st step: Show that p is false 2nd step: p implying q must be true 3rd step.
  - Trivial proof: 1st step: Show that q is true 2nd step: p implying q must be true 3rd step: q implying (p implying q).
  - Contradiction: 1st step: Assume that "not" statement p is true 2nd step: Show that step 1 will lead to a contradiction 3rd step: Therefore, statement p is true.
